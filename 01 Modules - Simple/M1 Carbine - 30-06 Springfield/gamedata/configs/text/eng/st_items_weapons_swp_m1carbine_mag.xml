		The M1 carbine entered service with a straight 15-round magazine, but the introduction of the M2 carbine in October 1944 brought into service the curved 30-round box magazine. After WWII, the 30-round magazine quickly became the standard magazine for both the M1 and M2 carbines, although the 15-round magazine remained in service until the end of the Vietnam War.</text>

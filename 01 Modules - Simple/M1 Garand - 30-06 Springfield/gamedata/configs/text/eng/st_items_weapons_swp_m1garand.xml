		<text>The M1 Garand is a semi-automatic rifle, developed in 1930s and adopted in 1936 as the service rifle of the US military. Widely considered the best service rifle of entire WWII - General Patton called it "the greatest battle implement ever devised" - it greatly increased the firepower of US infantry squads compared to typical squad of other countries, who used bolt-action rifles. Mechanically, M1 is a gas operated firearm, using a long-stroke gas piston system with rotating bolt. It is fed by a unique en-bloc clip holding 8 rounds.\n
		The M1 rifle was chambered in .30-06 Springfield round (7.62x63mm), which was standard cartridge back then, but the U.S. Navy rechambered it for the 7.62?51mm NATO round. The Mod 1 model fixed issues the previous Mod 0 had with the barrel, and added a piece of plastic to make sure the user didn't put the original 30-06 cartridge in the gun.\n

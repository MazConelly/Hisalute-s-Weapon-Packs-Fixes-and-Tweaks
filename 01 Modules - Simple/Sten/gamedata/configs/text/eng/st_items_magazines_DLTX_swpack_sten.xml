		<text>Standard 32 round Sten Magazine. These magazines were notorious for their unreliability, an issue further exacerbated by a tendency of some users to use the magazine as a grip. An overly tight grip on the magazine or the magazine well could cause deformation and reliability issues and should be avoided.</text>

		<text>Standard 32 round Sa 24/26 Magazine. Unlike many other magazines for the bottlenecked 7.62x25 round that are noticeably curved, these magazines are straight, lending them to be used in some 7.62x25 conversions for some SMGs.</text>

Production was relatively brief, none were made after the summer of 1943. This rifle has had its barrel shortened, allowing it to act as a pistol, the gas tube has also been adjusted to maintain automatic operation. The shortened barrel results in greatly decreased accuracy and muzzle velocity.</text>

		<text>A basic version of the Mosin-Nagant with slightly worn interiors. The M1891/30 was produced for standard issue to all Soviet infantry from 1930 to 1945. It was extremely successful in World War II as a sniper rifle when it was equipped with a 4x PE or a 3.5x PU scope. Due to an abundance of these rifles and a relative scarcity of pistols, sawn-off Mosin-Nagants were often used by those who needed a small, concealable weapon. The shortened barrel results in greatly decreased accuracy and muzzle velocity.\n

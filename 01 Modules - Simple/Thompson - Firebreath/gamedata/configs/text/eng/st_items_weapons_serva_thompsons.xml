		<text>The Thompson is a blowback-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed selective-fire submachine gun, invented and developed by John T. Thompson in 1918 to break the stalemate of trench warfare of World War I. It became notorious during the Prohibition era as the signature weapon of various organized crime syndicates in the United States in the 1920s, before being widely used by the Allies during World War II.\n
		The M1921 was the the first major production model, nicknamed the "Chicago Typewriter", and expensive to manufacture. It features a faster firerate and the Blish Lock system for weapon operation.</text>

		<text>The M1928 was the first variant of the Thompson produced primarily for military use. The original samples were Model 1921s with weight added to the actuator, which slowed down the cyclic rate of fire as required by the Navy. A front grip and muzzle device were also mounted by default.</text>

		<text>The M1A1 is a variant of the M1, a simplified Thompson model intended for the military that removed the front grip, muzzle device, and the ability to use drum magazines, and reduced the fire rate. The M1A1 was itself further simplified, with further changes, like the firing pin being machined to the face of the bolt, eliminating unnecessary parts. While this reduced the cost of the weapon to a third and eventually a fourth of the original M1921, the M1A1 had its fire rate further reduced.</text>

		<text>The Duplet is an improvised double-barreled shotgun manufactured by technicians in workshops near and in The Zone. It was produced by first stalkers in The Zone, since the black market of firearms was almost non-existent back then. Currently the Duplets are increasingly less common as more weaponry is available for cheap from traders and arms smugglers. It is a simple, crude firearm made from reinforced scrap metal and wood, with two barrels placed horizontally. The accuracy is low due to crude finish of the inside of the barrel, but it's not an issue since the gun is made for point-blank ranges. Two barrels hold one shell each and can be fired both in the same time. Due to questionable construction, unless one is very careful with the trigger, the weapon has a tendency to shoot both barrels at once.</text>

It is one of the most famous rifles in the world, widely considered the best service rifle of entire WWII - General Patton called it "the greatest battle implement ever devised". M1 was developed in 1930s by John Garand, Canadian-American weapons designer, and was adopted by US Army in 1936, replacing Sprinfield M1903 bolt-action rifle. More than 5 million of M1 Garand rifles were produced, and they greatly increased the firepower of US infantry squads compared to typical squad of other countries, who used bolt-action rifles. Mechanically, M1 is a gas operated firearm, using a long-stroke gas piston system with rotating bolt. It is fed by unique en-bloc clip holding 8 rounds.\n
		The M1 rifle was chambered in .30-06 Springfield round (7.62x63mm), which was standard cartridge back then, but a small amount of these rifles was converted to .308 Win after the war (so called Navy Garands).</text>

It was very well liked in the WWII and after and is widely regarded as a reliable and effective weapon that is very easy to control even for less experienced shooters. Over 6 millions of these weapons were produced, more than any other US WWII weapon. After the war the M1 was used up until Vietnam war by US and even longer by more than 50 other countries. M1 Carbine was sold in big numbers on civilian market in US, leading it to be a popular rifle for gunsmiths to customize and convert to different calibers. While this tendency has slowed due to shrinking rifle stocks and an increase in value of original configuration rifles, many customized rifles still exist.\n
		This particular rifle has been adapted to fire the more powerful .357 magnum round, and is fed using 9 round Desert Eagle magazines. This variant is somewhat more common in the Zone due to the rarity of the .30 carbine cartridge.</text>

		<text>M3 Grease Gun is a submachine gun chambered in .45ACP developed for US military during World War II. It was designed as a cheap weapon fit for rapid mass production in style of Sten and PPS-43 submachine guns. Before the M3, the US military's service submachine gun was Thompson M1928A1. It was a very good weapon, but it was very heavy and expensive in production. The M3 was made to fix this issue. Because of its crude, industrial aesthetics, the M3 was called the "Greaser" or "Grease Gun". Nonetheless, it was a relatively reliable weapon that was "just-good-enough" for war time. Slow rate of fire improved the controllability of the weapon and allowed for more accurate fire even in long bursts. The Grease Gun remained in service with US military up to Vietnam war, and was even used as late as in 1990s by Abrams crews because of their compact size. The M3 received an upgrade in the form of the M3A1, which simplified the gun, removing the charging lever among other changes. This one retains older, M3 pattern features.</text>

The differences from the M14 are an accurized match barrel, special synthetic stock with pistol grip, RIS rail for mounting optics and Harris bipod. The M14 is an American battle rifle chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO, which for a short time served as a service rifle of US military. Experiences of WWII showed a need for improvements over the M1 Garand rifle, with characteristics including higher capacity, modern ammunition and lighter weight. The M14 was meant to replace several weapon types, however, this proved to be an impossible task. The M14 was deemed "completely inferior" to the M1 Garand in a 1962 report by the Department of Defense comptroller, eventually being replaced by the M16. M14s with scopes are popular among hunters and sport marksmen. Few military M14 DMR rifles reached The Zone, where they are liked for very good optical sights, providing much better precision than low-power scopes of SVD rifles.\n

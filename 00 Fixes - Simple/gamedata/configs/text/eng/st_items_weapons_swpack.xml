	<string id="st_wpn_duplet_descr">
		<text>The Duplet is an improvised double-barreled shotgun manufactured by technicians in workshops near and in The Zone. It was produced by first stalkers in The Zone, since the black market of firearms was almost non-existent back then. Currently the Duplets are increasingly less common as more weaponry is available for cheap from traders and arms smugglers. It is a simple, crude firearm made from reinforced scrap metal and wood, with two barrels placed horizontally. The accuracy is low due to crude finish of the inside of the barrel, but it's not an issue since the gun is made for point-blank ranges. Two barrels hold one shell each and can be fired both in the same time. Due to questionable construction, unless one is very careful with the trigger, the weapon has a tendency to shoot both barrels at once.</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_garand_descr">
		<text>The M1 Garand is a World War II-era semi-automatic rifle that was the service rifle of the US military. It is one of the most famous rifles in the world, widely considered the best service rifle of entire WWII - General Patton called it "the greatest battle implement ever devised". M1 was developed in 1930s by John Garand, Canadian-American weapons designer, and was adopted by US Army in 1936, replacing Sprinfield M1903 bolt-action rifle. More than 5 million of M1 Garand rifles were produced, and they greatly increased the firepower of US infantry squads compared to typical squad of other countries, who used bolt-action rifles. Mechanically, M1 is a gas operated firearm, using a long-stroke gas piston system with rotating bolt. It is fed by unique en-bloc clip holding 8 rounds.\n
		The M1 rifle was chambered in .30-06 Springfield round (7.62x63mm), which was standard cartridge back then, but a small amount of these rifles was converted to .308 Win after the war (so called Navy Garands).</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_m1carbine_descr">
		<text>The M1 Carbine is a lightweight, semi-automatic carbine that was introduced to US military during World War II. It was meant to be a primary weapon of rear echelon troops and those soldiers who did not need or couldn't carry a long and heavy infantry rifle like M1 Garand. It was very well liked in the WWII and after and is widely regarded as a reliable and effective weapon that is very easy to control even for less experienced shooters. Over 6 millions of these weapons were produced, more than any other US WWII weapon. After the war the M1 was used up until Vietnam war by US and even longer by more than 50 other countries. M1 Carbine was sold in big numbers on civilian market in US, leading it to be a popular rifle for gunsmiths to customize and convert to different calibers. While this tendency has slowed due to shrinking rifle stocks and an increase in value of original configuration rifles, many customized rifles still exist.\n
		This particular rifle has been adapted to fire the more powerful .357 magnum round, and is fed using 9 round Desert Eagle magazines. This variant is somewhat more common in the Zone due to the rarity of the .30 carbine cartridge.</text>

		<text>The M1A1 Carbine is a paratrooper variant of M1 Carbine, a lightweight, semi-automatic carbine that was introduced to US military during World War II. It was developed specially for paratroopers, as it was very light and folding stock made it easier to airdrop with it. Apart from folding stock, the weapon is exactly the same. M1 Carbine was meant to be a primary weapon of rear echelon troops and those soldiers who did not need or couldn't carry a long and heavy infantry rifle like M1 Garand. It was very well liked in the WWII and after and is widely regarded as a reliable and effective weapon that is very easy to control even for less experienced shooters. Over 6 millions of these weapons were produced, more than any other US WWII weapon. Unlike the M1 Carbine, the M1A1 is a rare weapon and it is rarely seen outside museums and private collections, however, many fakes and reproductions exist.\n
		Among the more numerous conversions of the M1 Carbine is the 5.7x33mm Johnson cartridge. Parts from rifles of this configuration have been further used to adapt guns to the FN 5.7x28mm cartridge more commonly seen in the Zone, serving as a low cost alternative to the P90.</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_m14dmr_descr">
		<text>The US Marine Corps Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR) is a semi-automatic sniper rifle adapted from the M14 rifle, similar to the M21 rifle of US Army. The differences from the M14 are an accurized match barrel, special synthetic stock with pistol grip, RIS rail for mounting optics and Harris bipod. The M14 is an American battle rifle chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO, which for a short time served as a service rifle of US military. Experiences of WWII showed a need for improvements over the M1 Garand rifle, with characteristics including higher capacity, modern ammunition and lighter weight. The M14 was meant to replace several weapon types, however, this proved to be an impossible task. The M14 was deemed "completely inferior" to the M1 Garand in a 1962 report by the Department of Defense comptroller, eventually being replaced by the M16. M14s with scopes are popular among hunters and sport marksmen. Few military M14 DMR rifles reached The Zone, where they are liked for very good optical sights, providing much better precision than low-power scopes of SVD rifles.\n

		<text> The Smith and Wesson Model 500 is a five-shot, double/single action large-bore revolver originally firing the .500SW Magnum cartridge - the most powerful handgun cartridge in existence. The advanced design of the firearm helps in counteracting the recoil felt by the shooter. This includes the sheer weight of the firearm, use of rubber grips, the forward balance, and the use of a compensator. Nonetheless, the gun produces immense recoil.\n
		Due to the rarity of .500SW Magnum in the zone, ambitious gunsmiths have created modified copies, taking inspiration from the Russian RSh-12 revolver and converting the weapon to fire the subsonic 12.7Ã—55mm STs-130 cartridge shared by the ASh-12.7. These modifications have reduced the weapon's durability and lowered its potency, but the gun retains overwhelming power.</text>

		<text>The Serbu Super-Shorty is a compact, stockless, 12 gauge pump-action shotgun. This one is based on a Mossberg 500 receiver and features a spring-loaded, folding foregrip. The Super-shorty is a shotgun that is used exclusively for personal defense, as it doesn't have enough range and velocity to be used effectively for hunting. It can however deal very high damage in short range and bring down most attackers in one well placed shot. It is regarded as a very effective weapon against mutants who rely on ambushes and quick leaps to attack their victim. Most stalkers prefer cheaper double-barrel sawn-off shotguns for this task, but the Serbu Super-Shorty has better handling and slightly higher capacity.</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_borz_descr">
		<text>The Borz ("Wolf") initially referred to a clone of the Armenian K6-92, however it has become an umbrella term applied to all improvised submachine guns produced during the years of independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Only a few hundred Borzes were crafted at the "Krasniy Molot" plant, because production at this plant was stopped by the First Chechen War and moved into underground workshops. They are typically crude and inexpensive, with simple blowback operation, resulting in high rates of fire and low accuracy. The gun has fairly low durability, and may be best suited as a semi-disposable weapon, used to ambush and acquire higher quality guns from those that are better equipped.\n

It is available in multiple calibers and variants. the rifle is usually fed by a non-detachable internal magazine, with capacity varying based on caliber. Most common chamberings allowing 5 rounds, though larger rounds can reduce this to 4 or 3. While original 7.92mm rifles are exceedingly rare, made only for testing purposes and by special order, some after market conversions do exist.\n

		<text>The Springfield M1903 is an American bolt-action rifle originally chambered in .30-06 Springfield, serving as the US military service rifle before it was replaced by the famed M1 Garand. It was adopted in 1903 and fought in both World Wars, seeing use among the USMC in WWII due to an insufficient supply of Garands. It also saw use as sniper rifle, equipped with 2.5x or 8x scopes until the early Vietnam war. Two sniper variants were made, the M1903A1 "Marine" with 7.8x Unertl scope and M1903A4 with 2.5x scope. The Marine variant is considered to be a much better rifle, not only due to its high-power optic, but also its high quality finish and superior accuracy. Today Springfield rifles are used as target or hunting rifles all around the world. In Europe Springfields are very rare, nonetheless they are sometimes seen.\n
		This specimen was rechambered to .308 Winchester likely as .308 ammunition is cheaper and easier to obtain.\n

		<text>The Zastava M92 is a carbine developed and manufactured by Serbian Zastava Arms. The M92 is a shortened version of the Zastava M70 assault rifle, which is a modified copy of the Soviet AKM assault rifle. Unlike most rifle rounds which would otherwise experience a loss of velocity out of a shorter barrel, the 7.62x39mm round loses very little velocity when compared to a full length barrel. This makes it an excellent round for short-barrel rifles. The short barrel of the M92 may not lose enough velocity to even make a considerable difference when compared to the M70.\n
		This example comes in its base state with lightened parts, making it more suitable for long expeditions. \n

The AEK-919 is offered as a weapon for certain categories of personnel (crews of aircraft and combat vehicles), as well as special forces of law enforcement agencies. Its compact size has led some to utilize it as a sidearm, where its increased controllability comes at the cost of handling and weight.\n

The FALO was eventually replaced in service by variants of the FN Minimi.\n

		<text>The Vepr was the first indigenous Ukranian assault rifle, it was announced in 2003 and designed by the State Space Agency of Ukraine. It was made to replace the AKM and AK-74 in Ukranian service and was proclaimed to possess revolutionary upgrades over the AK-74. Practically, the rifle is a bullpup conversion of the AKM and boasts similar performance to the AK-74M. The bullpup configuration results in a more compact rifle, however this comes with ergonomical drawbacks and a heavy trigger pull. While it never saw widespread use, limited numbers found their way into the hands of servicemen and are a rare sight in the Zone.\n
		A few of these rifles were also converted to the 7.62x39mm cartridge, accepting standard AKM magazines.\n

		<text>The Volkspistole ("People's Pistol") 70 is a semi-automatic pistol chambered in 9x19mm, developed by Heckler and Koch. It was designed as a cheap semi-automatic pistol that could be quickly repurposed into a burst fire machine pistol/PDW with the addition of a polymer stock. The VP70 was a fairly revolutionary design with many modern features. It was the first mass-produced polymer pistol, predating the Glock 17 by 12 years and uses a spring-loaded striker, also featuring a high capacity 18 round double stack magazine. The VP70M is the military variant with provisions to attach a stock, within which a three round burst mechanism and selector switch is housed. When in burst mode, the cyclic rate of the pistol is a blistering 2200 rpm, though even with a stock it is difficult to control and of limited usefulness.\n
		Normally without the stock the gun is semi-auto only, however this example has been modified to allow burst fire as a standalone, though this has removed its single shot capability.\n

		<text>The IMI Desert Eagle is a semi-automatic handgun notable for chambering the largest centrefire cartridge of any magazine fed, self-loading pistol and also being the heaviest and blockiest gun of its type. No one knows why IMI thought shooting a calibre of this size out of a handgun was a good idea, even though there are plenty of rounds out there that can do the job without breaking your wrist; this one assumes because of a pissing contest between the .44 and .50 AE. Not only is it heavy and harsh in recoil, you can also use it to bludgeon your enemies to death because of its blockiness and weight. Although militaries and law enforcement around the world, in their moment of sanity, never adopted this brick; Hollywood did, mostly because of its "cool factor" and now is the poster child for gangsters and pimps and a status symbol for those who reached a certain rank in a certain console shooter. Rumour is that there's a Stalker with a crowbar wandering around the Zone with a rechambered version of this gun, but it's just a rumour.\n

		<text>The H&amp;K G-36 was known as the HK-50 project in early 1990s. After the cancellation of the G11 and G41 projects, the Bundeswehr was left with outdated G3 rifles; Heckler &amp; Koch was set to develop a new assault rifle for both the German army and for export. The new 5.56x45mm assault rifle was adopted by the Bundeswehr in 1995 and also found its way into the hands of various law enforcement agencies worldwide, including British police and some US police departments. So far, there have been very few complaints about this rifle. The more common ones being the overheating of the handguards during sustained fire, and the loss of zero on the built in scope of G36KE rifles. Some German soldiers also complained about the position of the dual optical sights and it being easily fogged in bad weather. Otherwise, it is accurate, reliable and simple in maintenance.\n

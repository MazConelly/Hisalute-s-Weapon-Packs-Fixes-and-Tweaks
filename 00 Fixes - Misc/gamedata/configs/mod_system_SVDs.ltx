;I Have no Idea if the below works in Anomaly

; Cammo preset HIGH
; KCS - new cammo variables - "1" - no bonus ; timer factor - above 1 bonus, below 1 penalty; distance factor - above 1 penalty, below 1 bonus;
; variables in weapon sesctions are multipliers on already determinated values from outfits.
; Number 1.1 means additonal 10% of bonus/penalty while 0.90 gives only 90% of previous calculated value, above comments is still valid for timer and distances what gives bonus and what penalty

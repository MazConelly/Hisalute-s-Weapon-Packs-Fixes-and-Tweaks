		<text>The Beretta 93R, also known as Raffica (Italian: "Burst") is a selective-fire machine pistol chambered in 9x19mm and developed in the late 1970s. It is a heavily redesigned Beretta 92, it uses the same base and system, but has differences such as a fire selector with semi and burst mode, in which it fires three rounds with cyclic rate of 1100RPM. It has a crude vertical grip and a ported barrel to reduce muzzle climb, however it is still considered to be hard to control in burst fire mode. It was used in limited numbers of Italian counter-terrorists, Carabinieri, police and paramilitary forces as a PDW.\n

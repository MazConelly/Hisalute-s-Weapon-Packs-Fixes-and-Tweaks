		<text>The Ingram MAC-10 (Military Armament Corporation Model 10), commonly known as the MAC-10, is a compact, select-fire, blowback operated machine pistol/submachine gun developed by Gordon B. Ingram in 1964. It can be chambered in either .45 ACP or 9mm.\n
		Firing from an open bolt, the light weight of the telescoping bolt results in a rapid rate of fire. The barrel is threaded to accept a two-stage suppressor by Sionics designed for the MAC-10, which not only abates the noise created, but also acts as a foregrip to inhibit muzzle rise when fired and makes it easier to control on full automatic (although it also makes the gun far less compact and concealable).\n
		The MAC series has been described as "fit only for combat in a phone booth".\n
		This is the .45 ACP model.\n

Ingram in the 1970s. The weapon is a sub-compact version of the Model 10 (MAC-10), and is chambered to fire the smaller .380 ACP round or 9mm.\n
		Noting the weapon's poor accuracy, the MAC series has been described as "fit only for combat in a phone booth".\n

		<text>The Spectre M4 is a 9x19mm submachine gun developed in 1980s by Italian manufacturer SITES for use by counter-terrorist and police units. It has a compact design and high rate of fire. Very short barrel and compact size place it close to weapons such as MP5K or Kiparis. High-capacity magazines hold 50 rounds of 9x19mm rounds, which allows for prolonged shooting, even though the weapon shoots very rapidly at 850 rounds per minute. Overally, the Spectre is a very compact submachine gun/machine pistol hybrid, but it's capacity and firepower is pretty high. In The Zone, Spectre submachine guns are sometimes available on black market and are well liked for their great handling, low weight and compact size, making it very good weapon for scavengers and artifact hunters who don't need a fighting weapon and just want something light to carry on them for personal defense from mutants and bandits at close range.</text>

		<text>The MP9 is a compact and versatile selective-fire submachine gun renowned for its reliability and ergonomic design by Brugger and Thomet, as a development of the Steyr TMP. It has gained popularity as a reliable firearm in military and law enforcement circles. It is made of polymer and also corrosion-resistant, with a stock that folds to the right side of the weapon, and an integrated Picatinny rail. Its design and ease of operability allows the user to holster the weapon like a machine pistol or personal defense weapon for rapid deployment in self-defence.\n
		The MP9-N is a further refined variant, firing at an increased fire rate. It is effective as PDW or for concealed carry for security and bodyguards.\n
		To augment its role as a PDW, certain technicians with more skill than sense have converted some of these guns to 5.7x28. The result is a surprisingly effective, low cost alternative to the P90.</text>

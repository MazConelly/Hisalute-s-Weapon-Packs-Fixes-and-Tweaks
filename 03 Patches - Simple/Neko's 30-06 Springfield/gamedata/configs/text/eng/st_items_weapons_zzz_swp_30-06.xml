		<text>The M1 Garand is a World War II-era semi-automatic rifle that was the service rifle of the US military. It is one of the most famous rifles in the world, widely considered the best service rifle of entire WWII - General Patton called it "the greatest battle implement ever devised". M1 was developed in 1930s by John Garand, Canadian-American weapons designer, and was adopted by US Army in 1936, replacing Sprinfield M1903 bolt-action rifle. More than 5 million of M1 Garand rifles were produced, and they greatly increased the firepower of US infantry squads compared to typical squad of other countries, who used bolt-action rifles. Mechanically, M1 is a gas operated firearm, using a long-stroke gas piston system with rotating bolt. It is fed by unique en-bloc clip holding 8 rounds.\n
		The M1 rifle is chambered in .30-06 Springfield round (7.62x63mm), the standard cartridge back then.\n

		<text>The M1 Carbine is a lightweight, semi-automatic carbine that was introduced to US military during World War II. It was meant to be a primary weapon of rear echelon troops and those soldiers who did not need or couldn't carry a long and heavy infantry rifle like M1 Garand. It was very well liked in the WWII and after and is widely regarded as a reliable and effective weapon that is very easy to control even for less experienced shooters. Over 6 millions of these weapons were produced, more than any other US WWII weapon. After the war the M1 was used up until Vietnam war by US and even longer by more than 50 other countries. M1 Carbine was sold in big numbers on civilian market in US, leading it to be a popular rifle for gunsmiths to customize and convert to different calibers. While this tendency has slowed due to shrinking rifle stocks and an increase in value of original configuration rifles, many customized rifles still exist.\n

		This particular rifle has been adapted to fire the more powerful .357 magnum round, and is fed using 9 round Desert Eagle magazines. This variant is somewhat more common in the Zone due to the rarity of the .30 carbine cartridge.\n

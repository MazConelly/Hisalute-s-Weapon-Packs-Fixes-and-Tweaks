Practically, the rifle is a bullpup conversion of the AKM and boasts similar performance to the AK-74M. The bullpup configuration results in a more compact rifle, however this comes with ergonomical drawbacks and a heavy trigger pull. The rifle never saw widespread use, limited numbers found their way into the hands of servicemen and are a rare sight in the zone. A few of these rifles were also converted to the 7.62x39mm cartridge, accepting standard AKM magazines.\n

Very short barrel and compact size place it close to weapons such as MP5K or Kiparis. High-capacity magazines hold 50 rounds of 9x19mm rounds, which allows for prolonged shooting, even though the weapon shoots very rapidly at 850 rounds per minute. Overally, the Spectre is a very compact submachine gun/machine pistol hybrid, but it's capacity and firepower is pretty high. In The Zone, Spectre submachine guns are sometimes available on black market and are well liked for their great handling, low weight and compact size, making it very good weapon for scavengers and artifact hunters who don't need a fighting weapon and just want something light to carry on them for personal defense from mutants and bandits at close range.</text>

The round also loses some muzzle velocity, lowering its power. The HK51 got adopted by SAS and SBS, but because of its faults it was withdrawn following the introduction of HK53 carbines using 5.56x45mm rounds that were more suitable for commando-length (~9-12.5" barrel) carbines.

		<text>The PSG-1 is a precision rifle based on the G3 battle rifle. It was designed from the beginning as a police sniper rifle for maximum precision. It boasts very high accuracy, but is also extremely expensive, leading to limited sales and a cessation of production in 2010. After the 1972 Munich massacre, Germany needed a semi-automatic rifle that would provide highest precision possible, eventually resulting in this gun and the WA2000. Mechanically it is just like the G3, though with features lending to higher precision. The PSG-1's accuracy is close to that of bolt-action sniper rifles, which is exceptional for a semi-automatic weapon. The rifle's weight, price and rather delicate construction makes it unsuitable for military use, leading to the development of the MSG90, with improvements aimed towards military conditions.

		<text>The AA-12 (Auto Assault-12), originally designed and known as the Atchisson Assault Shotgun, is an automatic combat shotgun developed in 1972 by Maxwell Atchisson. The most prominent feature is its constant recoil system, reducing felt recoil. The current 2005 version has been developed over 18 years since the patent was sold to Military Police Systems, Inc. The original design was the basis of several later weapons, including the USAS-12 combat shotgun. The shotgun fires in fully automatic mode only. However, the relatively low cyclic rate of fire of around 300 rounds per minute enables the shooter to fire semi-automatically de facto with brief trigger pulls. It is fed from either an 8-shell box magazine, or a 20- or 32-shell drum magazine. \n

It was developed mainly for police use with non-lethal grenades, but it is also popular among soldiers. Standalone grenade launchers are regaining popularity, as mounted underbarrel increase a weapon's weight and change balance too much, decreasing practical accuracy and making it uncomfortable to carry them for prolonged time.</text>

		<text>The Volkspistole ("People's Pistol") 70 is a semi-automatic pistol chambered in 9x19mm, developed by Heckler and Koch. It was designed as a cheap semi-automatic pistol that could be quickly repurposed into a burst fire machine pistol/PDW with the addition of a polymer stock. The VP70 was a fairly revolutionary design with many modern features. It was the first mass-produced polymer pistol, predating the Glock 17 by 12 years and uses a spring-loaded striker, also featuring a high capacity 18 round double stack magazine. The VP70M is the military variant with provisions to attach a stock, within which a three round burst mechanism and selector switch is housed. When in burst mode, the cyclic rate of the pistol is a blistering 2200 rpm, though even with a stock it is difficult to control and of limited usefulness.\n
		Normally without the stock the gun is semi-auto only, however this example has been modified to allow burst fire as a standalone, though this has removed its single shot capability.\n

The High Power is not a simple Hi-Power clone, featuring multiple improvements such as an increased 17 round capacity, ambidextrous controls, as well as changes preventing hammer bite. These changes, among others have resulted in a lack of parts commonality and magazine incompatibility with older Hi-Powers. Internally the gun differs from the original Hi-Power, though care has been taken to mimic the external appearance.\n
		While the original owner of this pistol had modifications made to allow for the mounting of an optic, the high cost of this weapon and that process led to the installation of a cheap and rather difficult to use reflex sight. \n

The Mk 48 has been developed in conjunction with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), which has adopted the weapon and started its fielding process, beginning with special operations units. The design is based on an early 7.62x51mm NATO prototype of the FN Minimi - Maximi, modified to be a scaled-up version of the 5.56 mm Mk 46 Mod 0. Compared to older M60 and M240 based designs, the MK48 provides increased portability, though with slightly decreased performance.

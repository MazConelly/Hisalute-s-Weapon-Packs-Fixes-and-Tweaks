		<text>The Vepr was the first indigenous Ukranian assult rifle, it was announced in 2003 and designed by the State Space Agency of Ukraine. It was made to replace the AKM and AK-74 in Ukranian service and was proclaimed to possess revolutionary upgrades over the AK-74. Practically, the rifle is a bullpup conversion of the AKM and boasts similar performance to the AK-74M. The bullpup configuration results in a more compact rifle, however this comes with ergonomical drawbacks and a heavy trigger pull. The rifle never saw widespread use, limited numbers found their way into the hands of servicemen and are a rare sight in the zone. A few of these rifles were also converted to the 7.62x39mm cartridge, accepting standard AKM magazines.\n

		<text>Saab CBJ-MS PDW is a Swedish submachine gun designed for personal defence weapon (PDW) role. It is a small and compact submachine gun of modular construction that can be chambered in 9x19mm and 6.5x25mm CBJ ammunition, but ambitious zone technicians have rechambered this particular weapon to 5.7x28mm FN. It is a blowback-operated, selective fire submachine gun which is based on the Israeli Uzi submachine gun. Among it's features is unusual equipment for an SMG such as a bipod, 100-round magazine, frontal grip which can also act like spare magazine housing and an optics rail. The CBJ is relatively lightweight at 2.8kg, but compared to modern PDWs with polymer parts it is heaviest of them all. In The Zone the CBJ is very rare, only a few came with Mercenary squads who use these weapons to improve their firepower.\n

		<text>The Spectre M4 is a 9x19mm submachine gun developed in 1980s by Italian manufacturer SITES for use by counter-terrorist and police units. It has a compact design and high rate of fire. Very short barrel and compact size place it close to weapons such as MP5K or Kiparis. High-capacity magazines hold 50 rounds of 9x19mm rounds, which allows for prolonged shooting, even though the weapon shoots very rapidly at 850 rounds per minute. Overally, the Spectre is a very compact submachine gun/machine pistol hybrid, but it's capacity and firepower is pretty high. In The Zone, Spectre submachine guns are sometimes available on black market and are well liked for their great handling, low weight and compact size, making it very good weapon for scavengers and artifact hunters who don't need a fighting weapon and just want something light to carry on them for personal defense from mutants and bandits at close range.\n

		<text>MP9 is a compact machine pistol designed and manufactured by Brugger and Thomet Co. of Switzerland. In itself it is a further development of Steyr TMP project, which was sold by Steyr in 2001. The MP9 shoots with high rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute, but is relatively easy to control and comfortable to shoot. The MP9-N is a further refined variant, firing at an increased 1100 rpm. It is effective as PDW or for concealed carry for security and bodyguards. It is currently used by multiple police and security forces, among them ones from France, Switzerland and Thailand. To augment its role as a PDW, certain technicians with more skill than reason have converted some of these guns to 5.7x28. The result is a surprisingly effective, low cost alternative to the P90.\n

		<text>The Mk18 is a special shortened carbine with commando-length barrel for improved handling and lower weight. The Mk18 is in essence an M4A1 carbine outfitted with Close Quarter Battle Receiver (CQBR) - a replacement upper receiver featuring a 10.3" (262mm) barrel. The shorter barrel makes the weapon significantly more compact and easier to use in and around vehicles and tight confined spaces. The Mk18 is praised for its light weight and short dimensions, making it very easy to handle. It has its drawbacks, however. The short barrel provides insufficient velocity for the bullet to display ideal wounding characteristics. Nonetheless, the Mk18 is a very good weapon in its niche and while it lacks universality of 14"-20"-barreled rifles it remains highly effective when used in suitable situations.\n
		This specific gun has been further specialized for CQC operations, featuring a 60 round quad stack magazine, increased rate of fire, and holographic sight. These features have increased its weight and decreased handling, though the increased firepower more than makes up for the cost.\n

The G18C additionally has a ported barrel to act as compensator to reduce muzzle rise in fully-automatic mode.

As a result of these modifications, this gun features slightly improved accuracy and less felt recoil than a conventional Saiga, though its cyclic rate has beeen reduced as a result.

		<text>The HK51 is a shortened variant of G3 battle rifle. Contrary to popular belief, it was not developed by Heckler and Koch, but Fleming Arms for British Special Forces. The HK51's short size improves handling but reduces reliability and makes the rifle more prone to overheating. The short barrel also results in a brighter muzzle flash and louder sound signature, together with increased recoil, which is already pretty high due to powerful 7.62x51mm round. The round also loses some muzzle velocity, lowering its power. The HK51 got adopted by SAS and SBS, but because of its faults it was withdrawn following the introduction of HK53 carbines using 5.56x45mm rounds that were more suitable for commando-length (~9-12.5" barrel) carbines. HK51 was later introduced into free market in semi-automatic variant, made from HK91 rifles (a civilian semi-auto variant of G3) and adapted to use MP5 furniture.\n

		<text>The AA-12 (Auto Assault-12), originally designed and known as the Atchisson Assault Shotgun, is an automatic combat shotgun developed in 1972 by Maxwell Atchisson. The most prominent feature is its constant recoil system, reducing felt recoil. The current 2005 version has been developed over 18 years since the patent was sold to Military Police Systems, Inc. The original design was the basis of several later weapons, including the USAS-12 combat shotgun. The shotgun fires in fully automatic mode only. However, the relatively low cyclic rate of fire of around 300 rounds per minute enables the shooter to fire semi-automatically de facto with brief trigger pulls. It is fed from either an 8-shell box magazine, or a 20- or 32-shell drum magazine.\n
